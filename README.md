Pazu is a small toy language. I'm starting with a Lisp-inspired syntax. The implementation borrows
heavily from [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) and
[Mary Rose Cook](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/21-little-lisp-interpreter).

There's not much to look at here yet. The immediate goal is to create a canvas to play with language
features.

VERSION 1 ROADMAP
-----------------
* Execution of simple arithmetic and string manipulation.
* Lambdas and lexical scoping
* List processing (map/reduce/filter)
* REPL
* Error handling

THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN
------------------------
* Type system
* Functionally reactive
